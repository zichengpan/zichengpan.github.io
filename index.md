<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    I am a Research Fellow at Griffith University, Australia. I completed my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at Griffith University in May 2025, where my research focused on deep learning and computer vision. My particular interests lie in incremental learning, domain adaptation, fine-grained classification, and vision-language models. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a combined Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from the University of Queensland in 2021.
