I am a PhD candidate at the School of Engineering and Built Environment at Griffith University, Australia. I completed a combined B.Eng (Hons) and M.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering at the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) at the University of Queensland in 2021. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision, with particular interests in incremental learning, domain adaptation, and visual-language models.
