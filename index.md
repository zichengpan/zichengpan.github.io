## About

I am a Research Fellow in the School of Engineering and Built Environment at Griffith University, Australia. I completed my PhD at Griffith University in 2025, where my research focused on deep learning and computer vision. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a combined Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from the University of Queensland in 2021.

I am recently working on these areas:
- **Incremental Learning**
- **Domain Adaptation**
- **Fine-grained Classification**
- **Vision-Language Models**
- **Large-Language Models**
