<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    I am a Research Fellow at Institute for Integrated and Intelligent Systems (IIIS) at Griffith University, Australia. I completed a combined B.Eng (Hons) and M.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland in 2021. Currently pursuing a PhD degree at Griffith University, my research focuses on deep learning and computer vision, with particular interests in incremental learning, domain adaptation, fine-grained classification, and vision-language models.
