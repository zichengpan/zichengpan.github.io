<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am a PhD candidate at the ARC Research Hub within the School of Engineering and Built Environment at Griffith University, Australia. I completed a combined B.Eng and M.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering at the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) at the University of Queensland in 2021. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision, with particular interests in incremental learning, domain adaptation, and visual-language models.

<!-- My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**. -->
